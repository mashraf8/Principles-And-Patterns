## Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle aims to make our software designs **cleaner and more focused**. This principle states that every class should have **only one responsibility** within the entire system. When a class adheres to this rule, it will have only one reason to be modified in the future â€“ a change related to that specific responsibility.


Simply put, when a class ignores this principle and takes on multiple responsibilities (e.g, a class that handles user data, performs financial calculations, and sends email notifications), it becomes more complex, harder to understand and modify, and more prone to errors whenever any change is made. Adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle helps avoid these problems.
