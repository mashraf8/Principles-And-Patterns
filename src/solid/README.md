# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design guidelines in object-oriented programming that help developers build software that is easy to maintain, extend, and scale. These principles promote clean code architecture, reduce tight coupling between components, and encourage better software design.

The acronym SOLID stands for:

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
  A class should have only one reason to change. It should only have one job or responsibility.

- **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
  Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new features without changing existing code.

- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
  Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without breaking the program's behavior.

- **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
  No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Instead of one large interface, use smaller, more specific ones.

- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.

By following these principles, developers can create robust, flexible, and maintainable codebases.
