# Structural Design Patterns

## What Are Structural Patterns?

**Structural patterns** are design patterns that focus on **how classes and objects are composed** to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure doesnâ€™t have to.

These patterns make it easier to **design flexible and efficient systems** by identifying simple ways to realize relationships between entities.

## Types of Structural Patterns

### 1. Adapter

Allows objects with **incompatible interfaces** to work together by **converting** one interface into another.

### 2. Bridge

**Decouples abstraction from implementation**, allowing both to vary independently.

### 3. Composite

Composes objects into **tree structures** to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### 4. Decorator

Dynamically adds **new responsibilities/behaviors** to an object without modifying its structure.

### 5. Facade

Provides a **unified, simplified interface** to a complex subsystem.

### 6. Flyweight

Reduces memory usage by **sharing common parts** of objects instead of duplicating them.

### 7. Proxy

Provides a **surrogate or placeholder** for another object to control access to it.
