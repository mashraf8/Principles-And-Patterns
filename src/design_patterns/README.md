# Design Patterns

## Overview

**Design Patterns** are reusable, time-tested solutions to common problems that occur in software design, especially in object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Relationship with SOLID Principles

Design Patterns and SOLID Principles work hand in hand.

- **SOLID** defines how to write clean, extensible, and testable object-oriented code.
- **Design Patterns** offer structured solutions for common software design problems.

## Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns

The **Gang of Four (GoF)** refers to the four authors of the famous book _"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"_. They introduced **23 classic patterns** divided into three categories:

### ðŸ”¹ Creational Patterns
- Concerned with the way of creating objects.
### ðŸ”¹ Structural Patterns
- Concerned with object and class composition.
### ðŸ”¹ Behavioral Patterns
- Concerned with communication between objects.

## Modern Design Patterns

With evolving practices and technologies (functional programming, DI frameworks, reactive architectures), modern design patterns have emerged or adapted from GoF to suit new paradigms.
