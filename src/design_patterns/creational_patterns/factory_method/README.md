# Factory Method Pattern

## What is Factory Method?
Factory Method is a design pattern that lets you create objects **without using `new` directly**.  
Instead, you use a **factory method** to create the object for you.

## Why Use It?

- To **hide the object creation** logic from the user.
- To **make your code easier to change or extend**.
- To follow the **Open/Closed Principle** â€“ open for extension, closed for modification
