# Singleton Design Pattern

## Definition

The **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class has **only one instance**, and provides a **global point of access** to it.

---

## Intent

- To restrict instantiation of a class to a **single object**.
- To **control access** to shared resources (e.g., database, configuration, logging).

---

## Real-World Examples

- Database connection pool
- Logger
- Configuration manager
- File system manager
- Thread pool
