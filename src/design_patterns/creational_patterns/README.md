# Creational Design Patterns

## What Are Creational Patterns?

**Creational patterns** are design patterns that focus on the **process of object creation**. They abstract the instantiation process and make the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Types of Creational Patterns

### 1. Ô∏èSingleton

Ensures that a class has **only one instance**, and provides a global point of access to it.

### 2. Factory Method

Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses or factories decide which class to instantiate.

### 3. Abstract Factory

Provides an interface to create **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

### 4. Builder

Separates the **construction of a complex object** from its representation. The same construction process can create different representations.

### 5. Prototype

Creates new objects by **cloning** existing ones (instead of creating from scratch).
